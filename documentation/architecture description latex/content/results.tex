The platform developed supports and is designed for various decision driven applications, which would include actuators and valves for controlling the amount of farm inputs. In the process of making the architecture industry ready, the following steps are needed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Designing a front end for platform management and deployment;
\item Designing industry-ready sensors for robust hardware and more reliable measurement;
\item Improving the mesh architecture for more stability; and
\item Adding field imagery and drone footage as sensory input.
\end{itemize}
