# Project Requirements

The project requirements (as given in the [Project Initiation Document](./PID_Project001.pdf)) are as follows:

```c
The end result of this work is a tangible and a low cost IoT (real-time) based farm sensing suite,
designed with the possibility for future scalablity. [1.3]

The HW identification, system (HW and SW) development, testing and integration is part of the
Project 001. Considering the project timeline, a fully scalable and functional solution is out of
scope. The data anlystics and output intelligence is also out of scope of this project.[3.2]

The requirements for Project 001 are listed below [3.2]:

1. Req1 – To develop an array of devices (integrated sensor) to sense the soil moisture for a 1 Ha
field.

2. Req2 – Record the metadata along with the sensed data (time, location, and device ID)

3. Req3 – Develop an information gateway for assembling and processing the signals from the devices

4. Req4 – Upload the to the server/cloud
```

The aforementioned 4 requirements are met. Moreover the designed architecture is fully scalable, and functional.
